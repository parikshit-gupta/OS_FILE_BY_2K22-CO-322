# OS_FILE_BY_2K22-CO-322
 Welcome to this repository! Here, we explore the core elements of operating systems, including scheduling algorithms, semaphore implementations, and more. Dive in with us as we simplify the complexities of OS design and implementation.  List of Experiments in OS Lab (Index) Shortest Job First (SJF) Shortest Remaining Time First (SRTF) First Come First Serve (FCFS) Round Robin (RR) Priority Scheduling Child process using fork() Bankerâ€™s Algorithm Dekker's Algorithm Reader and Writer Problem Optimal Page Replacement Algorithm Least Recently Used (LRU) Page Replacement Algorithm First In First Out (FIFO)
